Now, \upchord{Em}Old Mister \upchord{D}Johnson had\upchord{C} troubles o\upchord{B7}f his own \\
He had a yellow cat who wouldn't leave his home; \\
He tried and he tried to give the cat away, \\
He gave it to a man goin' far, far away. \\

\textbf{[Chorus]}	The cat came back the very next day,

\hspace{43pt}		The cat came back, they thought he was a goner

\hspace{43pt}		But the cat came back; he just couldn't stay away. \\

Now, the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight, \\
So he loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite; \\
He waited and he waited for the cat to come around, \\
Ninety seven pieces of the man is all that they found. \\

But you know...? \\
\textbf{[Chorus]} \\

So he gave it to a man going up in a balloon, \\
He told him for to take it to the man in the moon; \\
The balloon came down about ninety miles away, \\
Where the man is now, well I dare not say. \\

But you know...? \\
\textbf{[Chorus]} \\

So he gave it to a man going way out West, \\
Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best; \\
First the train hit the track, then it jumped the rail, \\
Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale. \\

But you know what? \\
\textbf{[Chorus]} \\

Now, the cat was a possessor of a family of his own, \\
With seven little kittens till there came a cyclone; \\
It tore the houses all apart and tossed the cat around, \\
The air was filled with kittens, but not one was ever found. \\

\textbf{[Chorus x2]}
